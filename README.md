ProductBacklogTimeline
======================
This is a simple viewer for a Product Backlog (PBL) and tool for release planning based on the velocity of already completed sprints.
By specifying capacity and effort done in already completed sprints the average, minimum and maximum velocity is calculated for making progress forecasts for upcoming sprints.
This forecast is used to compute completion forecasts for every item in the PBL.
The items for a PBL and the information about sprints can be imported fromcsv files.

##Future development:
- Release forecasts.
- Editing and saving of data.
- Diagram for release forecast.
- Tracking of changes in the PBL over time.
- Configurable column names for CSV import.
